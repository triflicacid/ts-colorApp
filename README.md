# Color

A basic online utility for exploring color

## Building
Execute `npm install` to install required NPM packages

Execute `npm run build` to build source code, then launch `index.html` in a browser (preferably Chrome)

## Improvment Ideas
- `Select > Image` : float to left, with filter options on the right?
- Account feature - normal and advanced
  - Save colors. *normal: limit number. advanced: unlimited.*
  - Create palletes, which are collections of colors. **advanced only**
  - Image filters in `Select > Image` **advanced only**
  - Download image from `Select > Image` **advanced only**
